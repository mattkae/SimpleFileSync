* V1.0
** DONE Recording file changes in zip files on the client 
** DONE Recording file changes in zip files on the server
** DONE Client scenario #1: Client is behind and server catches up by downloading zip files
** DONE Client scenario #2: Client is ahead and posts all changes to server
** DONE Reset script for data
** DONE Better configuration
*** DONE Specify save directories for data
*** DONE Specify data directory for load data
*** DONE Specify client update interval
** DONE Handle systems with different number representations (i32 vs i64, little vs big endian, etc)
** DONE Configuration documentation 
** DONE Getting started documentation
** DONE Install scripts

* V1.1
** TODO Testing suite
** TODO Improve command line options
** TODO Add the ability to watch multiple directories from the same process
** TODO Handle the client and server diverging (i.e. the server has new changes *and* the client has new changes). This will involve us doing some merge resolution if the client and server modify the same file. We will not handle this for version 1. 
** TODO Add a GUI frontend to the client daemon, so that the GUI speaks to the daemon and the client speaks to the server. This will be good for the future case of "merge issues". This GUI could even be a command-line gui, but we'll see what happens.
