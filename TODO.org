* v2.0
After using the application a bit, I have discovered two things:
1. The always-running server model is quite nice and good
2. The always-running client model is really terrible to work with

   As such, I will be revamping the client to look an awful lot like ~git~. This is a bit sad, but I think it is a good change overall. Here is my todo list:
** TODO The client will now handle a few commands, namely:
- ~update~: takes all of the changes that were made locally, and pushes them to the server revving the version
- ~status~: responds to the user with the files that have changed locally
- ~ping~: makes sure that the server is alive
** TODO The client will NOT run forever, and will, instead, consume commands as they are called from the commandline (this can use a GUI in the future, but it is not important for now)
** TODO New usage of the application will be ~simplefilesync_c update/status~.
